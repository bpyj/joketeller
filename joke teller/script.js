//so how we are going to do this is, we are going to call a joke api, to call a random joke. then we are going to pass that to a text to speech api, and it will tell us that joke. you can see that we have a very nice animated gif robot here. i got this from giffy dot com.

//we have this tell me a joke button. press it. a simple button, and it tells us a joke.
